version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Tateca API is a financial management system that allows users to manage groups, transactions, and settlements.
  This API provides endpoints for authentication, user management, group management, transaction tracking, and financial calculations.
  
  ## Authentication
  
  The API supports two authentication methods:
  
  1. **Firebase Authentication (iOS clients)**: Use `Authorization: Bearer <firebase_jwt_token>` header
  2. **API Key Authentication (Lambda systems)**: Use `X-API-KEY: <api_key>` header
  
  User identification is handled automatically through the authentication system and doesn't require additional headers.
